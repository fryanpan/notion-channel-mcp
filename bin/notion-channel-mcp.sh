#!/bin/sh
# Launcher for the notion-channel-mcp MCP server.
#
# Why this exists — three separate failures, all fixed here.
#
# 1. PATH. plugin.json used to say `"command": "bun"`, which only works when bun
#    happens to be on the launching process's PATH. bun installs to ~/.bun/bin,
#    which is on PATH only because ~/.zshrc puts it there. Verify with:
#
#        env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin sh -c 'command -v bun'   # finds nothing
#
#    So any session not launched from an interactive shell (launchd, a GUI app,
#    cron, a non-login shell) died at spawn with a bare
#
#        Connection failed (ENOENT): Executable not found in $PATH: "bun"
#
#    and from inside the session the plugin was simply absent. /bin/sh is the one
#    interpreter guaranteed to be present, so it does the resolution itself
#    instead of trusting the inherited environment. Resolving at runtime (rather
#    than hardcoding an absolute path) also survives a bun reinstall or upgrade.
#
# 2. Dedup. Claude Code keys plugin-MCP dedup on the command shape — literally
#    `stdio:` + JSON.stringify([command, ...args]). All three channel plugins
#    declared the identical ["bun", "./server.ts"], so this one lost the race and
#    was silently suppressed:
#
#        Suppressing plugin MCP server "plugin:notion-channel-mcp:notion-channel":
#          duplicates earlier plugin server "plugin:github-claude-channel:..."
#
#    Referencing this script through ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} makes the argv
#    distinct per plugin. The script filename is distinct too, so the key stays
#    distinct even if placeholder expansion ever moved after the dedup pass.
#
# 3. Secrets. NOTION_INTEGRATION_TOKEN used to reach the server one way only:
#    bun auto-loads .env from the working directory, and .env happened to sit in
#    the plugin directory. That is not a real config mechanism — .env is
#    gitignored, so anyone installing this plugin from GitHub gets a server that
#    starts cleanly and then fails every Notion API call. It is also fragile for
#    the author: the plugin cache is keyed by version, so each release lands in a
#    fresh directory. Config now comes from a stable user-level path that no
#    release can orphan. The plugin-local .env still works as a fallback.
#
# Usage: /bin/sh notion-channel-mcp.sh <path-to-server.ts> [args...]
